# Public_sim_
A Python based routing simulator. Takes the XML map data taken form OSM format maps and a matrix of times to reach each stop from another stop. This maxtrix was generated with a C++ based routing solver and imported into the simulator.
The sim will output a graph showing the vehicle routes as well as output the connections that the vehicles and passengers take. ~Will be added to log output soon~~
To run the simulator run the main.py file.
