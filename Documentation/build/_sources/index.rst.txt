Welcome to Public_Python_Sim's documentation!
=============================================
**Public_Sim** Is a simple 2d graph based routing simulator. This simulator has been designed for academic use by
Alexander Masterman at the University of Southampton. The graphic simulator uses a cartesian coordinate system for the
stops within a network and a matrix of times needed to travel between any two nodes. These can be generated using
`Open Street Map <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>`_ data an the C++ based routing engine from the `Open Source Routing
Machine Project <https://project-osrm.org/>`_.
